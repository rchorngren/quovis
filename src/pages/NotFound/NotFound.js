                                saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
                                distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
                                prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
                                 pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
                                 obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated
                                 and annoyances accepted."
